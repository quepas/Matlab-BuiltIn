# Scraped MATLAB built-ins functions and classes

This folder contains lists of built-ins for different MATLAB versions.
Each CSV file consists of two columns, one with function name (`func`), and other with its description (`desc`).
The `latest.csv` list is scraped from [on-line MATLAB documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/functionlist-alpha.html) (available to anyone).
However, access to documentations of older MATLAB releases require MathWorks account.
Thus, for simplicity the older lists were scarped from off-line webpages (saved by the user).


## Comment
Lists of MATLAB built-ins from version __R2012b__ are correct (documentation webpages for these releases are regular HTML tables).
However, for even older versions the documentation webpages are irregular, thus scraped data have some errors. Beware.
